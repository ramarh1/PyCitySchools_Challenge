# PyCitySchools_Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores for ninth graders in Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data the same. After replacing the ninth grade test scores, the school disitrict analysis was repeated to see the difference between the original and updated analysis.

## Results
◦	How is the district summary affected?

As displayed in the tables, the updated district summary has lower  percentages since we altered the scores of the ninth graders in Thomas High School. The difference is not very large, but it is still a difference nonetheless.

 ◦ How is the school summary affected?
 
 Like the district analysis, the  percentages in the Thomas High School row were lower than the percentages in the old school summary. This is due to the alteration of ninth grade students' math and reading scores.

◦	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

As displayed in the tables, Thomas High School maintained its position in the top 5 performing schools, as the second greatest performing high school in the district.

◦	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 * Math and reading scores by grade
Like the previous percentages, the math and reading scores by grade did not change significantly. The grades for the ninth-graders at Thomas High School were replaced with Nan values.
 * Scores by school spending
Looking at the scores by school spending, they did not change when we altered the ninth-grade reading and math scores.  
 * Scores by school size
Looking at the scores by school size, the medium size school percentage for the passing math percentage, passing reading percentage, and the overall percentage are 0.1 less than the older scores we analyzed with the ninth-grade students from Thomas High School.
 * Scores by school size
The percentages for % passing reading, % passing math, and % overall passing in the charter school type decreased by 0.1 percent, as it did with the previous values.

## Summary
In all, the overall percentage in the updated district summary decreased compared to the old district summary, just like percentages in the school summary for the Thomas High School row, the math, reading, and overall passing percentages for the scores for the medium school size and the scores for the charter school type.
